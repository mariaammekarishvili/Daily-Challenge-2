<p>Author Hans Christian Anderson once said, "Just living is not enoughâ€¦ One must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower."

Indeed, freedom is something we can all get behind as a vital element of happiness, and an increasing body of research has found that spending time outside in the sunshine is crucial for our mental and physical well-being. But now, a new study from the University of North Florida, has found that having flowers in one's home does a lot more than simply enhance your living room's aesthetic appeal.

"There is a growing body of research that illustrates how environmental design positively impacts health," Erin Largo-Wight, Ph.D., Associate Professor of University of North Florida's Department of Public Health and lead author of the study, said. "Now it is both intuitive and scientifically known that adding elements of nature, like flowers, to interiors promotes well-being."
